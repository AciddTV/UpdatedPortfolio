# UpdatedPortfolio

**Please note**:
There is a section of this portfolio called Code Snippets, this section is a result of projects that are confidential, but still contain files or snippets of code that I find worth being in this portfolio.

Current Projects within this portfolio:

## Mapbox: 
A navigation app made in Java using MapboxSDK, designed for the Android environment.

## Code Snippets: 
This includes snippets of C# code and C++ code, and can include sections of project files.

## Game Engine (OpenGL) (Code Snippets): 
These are some of the files (including the main game cpp file). This project is creating a game engine in C++ using OpenGL. This project includes Shaders.

## Farm EVIL (Source): 
This is a game that myself and a group created in university. Here you will find the source project for the game. The game itself is an informative game focusing on the effects of unethical farming and corporate greed. Fun!

## Farm EVIL (Game): 

Here you will find the compiled game files for Farm EVIL (winx86-64).

## Outage API:

While working for Fibrestream, an Internet Service Provider, I created an API using ASP.NET Core MVC that the support team could use to communicate network outages with clients.

Rather than letting the customers see this screen (hence the lack of front-end), the values are stored in a SQL Server database, and are also updated in an API section of the program.

This API is used by the company's call flow program, 3CX, so that when customers call the support team, they are informed of any and all outages that are being experienced, all in real-time!

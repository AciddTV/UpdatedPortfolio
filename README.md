# UpdatedPortfolio

**Please note**:
There is a section of this portfolio called Code Snippets, this section is a result of projects that are confidential, but still contain files or snippets of code that I find worth being in this portfolio.

Current Projects within this portfolio:

## Mapbox: 
A navigation app made in Java using MapboxSDK, designed for the Android environment.

## Code Snippets: 
This includes snippets of C# code and C++ code, and can include sections of project files.

## Game Engine (OpenGL) (Code Snippets): 
These are some of the files (including the main game cpp file). This project is creating a game engine in C++ using OpenGL. This project includes Shaders.

## Farm EVIL (Source): 
This is a game that myself and a group created in university. Here you will find the source project for the game. The game itself is an informative game focusing on the effects of unethical farming and corporate greed. Fun!
